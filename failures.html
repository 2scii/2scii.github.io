            I think keeping a record of eventful failures is just as important as
                keeping a record of successful projects.

                Sometimes I genuinely forget how many times I've failed, faced rejection or 
                was just so close yet missed the mark.
                So I created this page to both reflect on important lessons I've learned
                and ground myself in the things that I do.

           <p> I've attempted to learn (not an exhaustive list) electronics, computer science,
             python, discrete math and c++. </p> 
         
            <p>What made them failed attempts was the fact that I never finished any of the coursework,
            textbook or exercises that I made as an objective in the beginning.
            I'd start, have the momentum of a new exciting learning experience, and then ultimately fizzle out.
            </p>

            <p> I learned 3 important lessons from this (there are probably a lot more but this is what comes to mind): </p>
                    <details>
            <summary>Learning in class is different from independent learning</summary>
            <p>This may seem very obvious to a lot of people. But when putting it to practice,
                it goes to show the ease of following school curriculum.
                The luxury of not needing to worry about where and how to start a topic,
                when to cover certain concepts and what learning resources to use, 
                were all things I took for granted.
                I was very good at following school curriculum, staying on top of work
                and understanding the key objectives but when it came to indepedent learning,
                I realized I was following nothing so it became easy to lose my momentum and stop 
                learning. 
            </p>
        </details>

                            <details>
            <summary>I don't need to complete my objective to have learned something valuable.</summary>
            <p>There is a certain satisfaction with completing every homework problem.
                A certain satisfaction with covering everything outlined in the course notes like the back of my hand.
                It feels complete and certain.
            </p>

            <p>
                But what feels unsettling is to leave a book barely even read. 
            </p>

            <p>
                To leave a textbook only having done the first chapter.
            </p>

            <p>
                To leave an online course having done one lesson.
            </p>

            <p>
                But I've done it countless times and they weren't in vain.
                I remember watching a CS50 (online programming course) introductory video teaching binary representation.
                Later, I found it became useful in my first year programming course because I had an experience
                that made it feel familiar. 
                Sure, I only did like ... 1% of the CS50 course but starting and stopping was way better 
                than having never started at all.

            <summary>Learning what to do without anyone telling me what to do.</summary>
            <p>I'm sure this above point is something everyone wishes for: freedom.
                Freedom to do anything without anyone telling you what to do.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a kid, that was a freedom I desired and sought after by 
                taking on challenges like starting a school club, joining choir 
                without a musical background, and taking math contests I knew I wasn't going to win. 
                But as a student who felt a need to learn as much as possible in a short time to meet
                the demands of the world, to be someone capable, to be experienced, freedom felt
                in many ways like a burden.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I used to wish I could have someone spoon-feed me the answers of what to do and when to do something.
                How do I learn machine learning? What do I use to learn machine learning? 
                In which order do I learn the topics? What resource is the best to get started?
                How can I maximize my time spent learning so I can become as skilled as possible, as fast as possible?
                If someone with years of experience designed a course, these answers would be easy... -easeier.
                I could follow someone else's pre-made path without feeling like I stumbled in the wrong 
                direction.
            </p>

            <p>
                But I've come to realize after reflecting on things I've learned/continue to learn such as
                building this website, it becomes easier to derive the answers to my own questions when I just start.
                If I don't know what direction to go, I must go pick a direction and just start moving otherwise
                I'll never start, I'll never learn and I'll never get anywhere. 
                The fear of going down the wrong path and doing things the hard way without much benefit
                will always linger in the back of my mind but overtime, explorers learn how to use their instincts
                to guide them to better places.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I don't learn how to learn on my own without any roadmap, without anyone telling me what to do,
                I will never build my own instincts and I will never forge a path that is truly my own. Maybe that is 
                actually much scarier than going down a difficult path.

            <div class = "text-container">

                I wanted to get into proofs-based mathematics.
                I searched online and found that discrete math was a good place to start.
                I maybe read 10-15 pages of Kenneth Rosen's Discrete Mathematics textbook.
                Did maybe a few exercises in the introductory chapter.
                And well.. that was it.
