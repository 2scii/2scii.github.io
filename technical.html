                <p> I wish I had more photos of my technical work. 
                    Unfortunately, I didn't think much about documentation in previous years.
                    Here are a few snippets of technical past work I've been involved in.

                A box I designed using CAD to hold an arduino.
                I realized later that there were not many error margins 
                which led to some issues with accessing the ports.

                As part of the Robotics Team, I helped with building and design. 
                Part of the challenge was our limited number of supplies due to shipping delays.
                I found a creative work around for the hook-conveyor belt system
                as well as finding an alternative to using wheels for intake and instead using rubber bands.

                A fond memory! This was my first ever technical project: building a PC.
                Honestly building a PC is much easier than it sounds when ordering the parts.
                The hard part was troubleshooting, finding part compatibility, ensuring the parts had the specs I wanted, 
                and researching case, cooler and fan combos for better air flow.
