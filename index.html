            <summary>Art Background</summary>
            <p>I am a self-taught artist and have been drawing for the past 13 years.
                I learned digital art and have been an avid user of Krita (open-source animation software) for 5 years where I dabbled in animation and photo editing.
                I have a dream of bringing engineering, mathematics and art together.
                I am inspired by: Can't Help Myself (Sun Yuan and Peng Yu), Kryptos (Jim Sanborn), Relativity (M. C. Escher).
