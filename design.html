                <p>I made this cute little box logo for my ECE198 course where our group
                    made an environmental sensor using an arduino and breadboard circuit.
                    It wasn't a requirement but I thought it'd be a nice touch to our project.

                    <p>This design reminds me of high school!
                        It was a last minute request right before school ended and I remember the hours flying
                        by as I worked away at the digital art. The hardest part was really getting a good, satisfying idea. 
                       My inspiration came from the sunrises next to the floor to ceiling
                       windows in the school's giant multipurpose room. 
                    I remember early mornings of volunteer events with stunning pink-orange skies.
